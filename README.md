Practicing [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) and [Expo](https://docs.expo.dev/) remotely on [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces) using the <code>expo start --tunnel</code> command due to issues with my outdated laptop. Build times are significantly faster.

Most of the examples are taken from Expo snack samples.

I added the <code>Drawer Navigation</code> from React Navigation to quickly switch between the examples.
 However, certain parts of expo doesn't seem to work.


It has some issues though. <code>React Devtools</code> won't connect. <code>Expo Dashboard</code> shows a blank screen.
